> W3C Web Authentication API Relying Party for Node.js and Express

WebAuthn is a [W3C standard][w3c] that enables web developers to replace passwords in their applications with [FIDO authentication][fido2]. This repository implements a NPM package for use in Node.js services. **This package is in active development and not yet ready for production use. You can use it to kick the tires on WebAuthn. Please file issues to ask questions or provide feedback.**

## Security

This package is not yet ready for use in production software. For more information on security considerations see [W3C Web Authentication][w3c-sec] and [FIDO Security Reference][fido-sec].

[w3c-sec]: https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#security-considerations
[fido-sec]: https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-rd-20180702/fido-security-ref-v2.0-rd-20180702.html

## Install

```sh
$ npm install webauthn
```

## Usage

See [examples](./example) for a complete example. The package currently works on its own and we plan to support Passport.js integration in future releases.

```javascript
const WebAuthn = require('webauthn')

// configure express and session middleware; see "examples" in this repository
// ...

// Create webauthn
const webauthn = new WebAuthn({
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
  usernameField: 'username',
  userFields: {
    username: 'username',
    name: 'displayName',
  },
  store: new LevelAdapter(),
  // OR
  // store: {
  //   put: async (id, value) => {/* return <void> */},
  //   get: async (id) => {/* return User */},
  //   delete: async (id) => {/* return boolean */},
  // },
  rpName: 'Stranger Labs, Inc.',
  enableLogging: false,
})

// Mount webauthn endpoints
app.use('/webauthn', webauthn.initialize())

// Endpoint without passport
app.get('/secret', webauthn.authenticate(), (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Super Secret!' })
})
```

Client

```javascript
import Client from 'webauthn/client'

const client = new Client({ pathPrefix: '/webauthn' })

await client.register({
  username: 'AL1C3',
  name: 'Alice',
})

// ...

await client.login({ username: 'AL1C3' })
```

### Relying Party

**`new WebAuthn(options)`**

The main entrypoint for creating a new WebAuthn RP instance. `options` is used
to configure the behaviour of the RP. Available options include:

- `origin` - The origin of the deployed application.
- `rpName` - The display name of RP. This will be shown in the WebAuthn consent
interface.
- `[usernameField = 'name']` - The name of the field that uniquely identifies a
user.
- `[userFields = ['name', 'displayName'] ]` - One of:
  - An array of properties from registration request to be included in the saved
  user object
  - An object mapping, where the key is the name of a property from the
  registration request to be included in the user object and the value is the
  name of that property on the user object.
- `[store = MemoryAdapter]` - The storage interface for user objects. Defaults
to an object in memory (for testing only).
- `[attestation = 'none']` - the [attestation conveyance preference](
https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#enum-attestation-convey). Setting this to
anything other than `'none'` will require attestation and validate it.
- `[credentialEndpoint = '/register']` - the path of the credential attestation
challenge endpoint.
- `[assertionEndpoint = '/login']` - the path of the challenge assertion
endpoint.
- `[challengeEndpoint = '/response']` - the path of the challenge response
endpoint.
- `[logoutEndpoint = '/logout']` - the path of the logout endpoint.
- `[enableLogging = true]` - Enable or disable logging to stdout.

**`webauthn.initialize()`**

Returns an [Express Router][express-js-router] with the mounted WebAuthn
endpoints.

**`webauthn.authenticate([options])`**

Returns an [Express Middleware][express-js-middleware] that will set `req.user`
for subsequent middlewares, or produce a `401 Unauthorized` error if the user is
not authenticated. Available options include:

- `[failureRedirect]` - If the user fails to authenticate then they will be
redirected to the supplied URL.

### Storage Adapater

Storage adapters provide an interface to the WebAuthn RP to store and retrieve
data necessary for authentication, such as authenticator public keys. You can
use the provided LevelDB adapter or write your own to interface with your
database.

The WebAuthnUser object interface is as follows:

```ts
interface Credential {
  // The credential format (for now this is the string "fido-u2f").
  fmt: string,

  // base64url encoded credential ID returned by the authenticator on
  // registration.
  credID: string,

  // PKCS#8-encoded encoded public key as a base64url string.
  publicKey: string,

  // Signature counter (https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#signature-counter) for
  // the credential.
  counter: number,

  // Credential transport
  // (https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#dom-publickeycredentialdescriptor-transports).
  transports: string[],
};

interface WebAuthnUser {
  // base64url-encoded sequence of 32 random bytes that identifies the user
  // uniquely, generated by WebAuthn. Avoid replacing this ID with something
  // else, user IDs in WebAuthn must be random.
  id: string,

  // List of credentials associated to the user.
  credentials: Credential[],
};
```

Additionally, `WebAuthnUser` will have any attributes declared on
`options.userFields` set.

Storage adapters must implement the following interface:

```ts
async function get (id: string): WebAuthnUser
```

Retrieves and returns the previously stored WebAuthnUser with the provided `id`.

```ts
async function put (id: string, webAuthnUser: WebAuthnUser): void
```

Stores a WebAuthnUser object so that it may be retrieved with the provided `id`.
Returns nothing.

```ts
async function delete (id: string): boolean
```

Delete a previously stored object. Returns a boolean indicating success.

### Browser Client

**`new Client([options])`**

Constructs a new client for handling interaction with the Web Authentication API
and the server authentication endpoints. Available options include:

- `[pathPrefix = '/webauthn']` - A mounting prefix to all authorization
endpoints.
- `[credentialEndpoint = '/register']` - The path of the credential registration
endpoint.
- `[assertionEndpoint = '/login']` - The path of the challenge assertion
endpoint.
- `[challengeEndpoint = '/response']` - The path of the challenge response
endpoint.
- `[logoutEndpoint = '/logout']` - The path of the logout endpoint.

Returns a new client instance.

**`async client.register(data)`**

Completes a start-to-finish registration of a new authenticator at the remote
service with the following steps:

1. Fetch a register credential challenge from the remote server's
`credentialEndpoint`.
2. Prompt the [Credentials Management API][cred-mgmt-api] to generate a new
local credential.
   - The Credentials Management API prompts the user for consent.
   - The challenge is signed using the user-selected method and returned.
3. The signed challenge is returned to the remote server's `challengeEndpoint`.

Returns the response of the request to the `challengeEndpoint`.

**`async client.login(data)`**

Completes a start-to-finish assertion challenge on a previously registered
remote service with the following steps:

1. Fetch an assertion challenge from the remote server's `assertionEndpoint`.
2. Prompt the [Credentials Management API][cred-mgmt-api] to get an existing
local credential and sign the response.
   - The Credentials Management API prompts the user for consent.
   - The challenge is signed and returned.
3. The signed challenge is returned to the remote server's `challengeEndpoint`.

Returns the response of the request to the `challengeEndpoint`.

**`async client.logout()`**

Destroys the current session on the remote server. Returns the result of the
request to the `logoutEndpoint`.
